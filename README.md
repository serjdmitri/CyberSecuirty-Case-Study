# Cybersecurity Case Study – Group Project

In my cybersecurity class, I worked on a group project where we had to figure out how hackers broke into a cybersecurity company and stole information. Our teacher gave us a large set of digital evidence, like emails, access logs, and file data. Each person in our group of three went through all the same evidence on our own, so we could compare what we found. If someone noticed something another person didn’t, we talked about it and added it to our report.

We didn’t use any special tools—we read through the data manually to look for clues. We focused on things like strange logins, file changes, and other red flags. After we each finished our individual research, we combined our findings and created a group presentation explaining how the attack happened, what was stolen, and what could have been done to stop it.

The part I found most interesting was learning about different ways companies can prevent cyberattacks. This project helped me better understand how real-world hacks happen, how teams investigate them, and how important strong security is.
